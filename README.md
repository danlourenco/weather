# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

Based on my analysis, here are the key structural issues and improvement opportunities:

  Major Antipatterns & Issues:

  1. Memory Leaks (Critical)

  - setInterval in components never cleared, causing memory leaks
  - Time updates run forever even when components unmount

  2. Poor Error Handling

  - Unsafe array access: json.features[0] without bounds checking
  - Missing null checks and fallbacks
  - Inconsistent error patterns across pages

  3. Mixed Responsibilities

  - Components handle both display AND navigation logic
  - Data fetching scattered across individual page components
  - Business logic mixed with presentation

  4. Hard-coded Values

  - 3-second navigation delays
  - API endpoints scattered throughout
  - Magic numbers for intervals and timeouts

  Key Refactoring Opportunities:

  1. Extract Services Layer

  // Centralize weather API calls
  class WeatherService {
    static async getCurrentConditions(coords: string) {}
    static async getForecast(coords: string) {}
  }

  2. Create Reusable Components

  - Extract repeated navigation patterns
  - Build shared loading/error states
  - Consolidate styling patterns

  3. Improve Type Safety

  - Define proper API response types
  - Add runtime validation
  - Remove unsafe type assertions

  4. Fix UX Antipatterns

  - Remove auto-playing audio (accessibility issue)
  - Replace hard-coded navigation delays with user control
  - Add proper loading states

  5. State Management

  - Implement proper caching for API responses
  - Add shared state for weather data
  - Centralize navigation logic

  The app works but has fragile architecture. Priority should be fixing memory leaks, improving error handling, and extracting shared
  logic into services.
