# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

Based on my analysis, here are the key structural issues and improvement opportunities:

  Major Antipatterns & Issues:

  1. Memory Leaks (Critical)

  - setInterval in components never cleared, causing memory leaks
  - Time updates run forever even when components unmount

  2. Poor Error Handling

  - Unsafe array access: json.features[0] without bounds checking
  - Missing null checks and fallbacks
  - Inconsistent error patterns across pages

  3. Mixed Responsibilities

  - Components handle both display AND navigation logic
  - Data fetching scattered across individual page components
  - Business logic mixed with presentation

  4. Hard-coded Values

  - 3-second navigation delays
  - API endpoints scattered throughout
  - Magic numbers for intervals and timeouts

  Key Refactoring Opportunities:

  1. Extract Services Layer

  // Centralize weather API calls
  class WeatherService {
    static async getCurrentConditions(coords: string) {}
    static async getForecast(coords: string) {}
  }

  2. Create Reusable Components

  - Extract repeated navigation patterns
  - Build shared loading/error states
  - Consolidate styling patterns

  3. Improve Type Safety

  - Define proper API response types
  - Add runtime validation
  - Remove unsafe type assertions

  4. Fix UX Antipatterns

  - Remove auto-playing audio (accessibility issue)
  - Replace hard-coded navigation delays with user control
  - Add proper loading states

  5. State Management

  - Implement proper caching for API responses
  - Add shared state for weather data
  - Centralize navigation logic

  The app works but has fragile architecture. Priority should be fixing memory leaks, improving error handling, and extracting shared
  logic into services.




  ⏺ Perfect! I've successfully addressed the mixed responsibilities issue by implementing a comprehensive
  separation of concerns. Here's what I accomplished:

  Mixed Responsibilities - Fixed!

  1. Navigation Service (/src/lib/services/navigation.ts)

  Before: Navigation logic scattered across every component
  // Repeated in every component
  const goToSomewhere = () => goto(`/weather/${data.coords}/somewhere`);

  After: Centralized navigation service
  export class WeatherNavigation {
    static goToCurrentConditions(coords: string): void
    static goToLocalForecast(coords: string): void
    static goToHazards(coords: string): void
    // etc...
  }

  2. Data Transformation Service (/src/lib/services/weatherTransforms.ts)

  Before: Data processing mixed with presentation logic
  // Components doing their own data transformation
  const temp = Math.round(celsiusToFahrenheit(data.latestObservations.temperature?.value || 0));

  After: Dedicated transformation functions
  export function getSafeTemperature(observation: WeatherObservation, converter: Function): number
  export function getSafeHumidity(observation: WeatherObservation): number
  export function isValidWeatherObservation(observation: WeatherObservation): boolean

  3. Reusable UI Components

  Before: Duplicated UI patterns across components
  <!-- Repeated error display pattern -->
  <div class="flex h-full items-center justify-center">
    <div class="text-center">
      <h2 class="mb-8 text-4xl">Error Title</h2>
      <p class="text-2xl">Error message</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  After: Reusable components
  - ErrorDisplay.svelte - Consistent error messaging
  - WeatherDataGrid.svelte - Reusable data grid pattern
  - ClickableWeatherCard.svelte - Consistent clickable weather cards

  4. Clear Separation of Concerns

  Components Now Focus On:
  - Presentation logic only
  - User interactions
  - UI state management

  Services Handle:
  - Navigation logic
  - Data transformation
  - Business logic validation

  5. Benefits Achieved:

  1. Maintainability: Navigation changes only require updating one service
  2. Reusability: Data transformation logic can be reused across components
  3. Testability: Services can be unit tested independently
  4. Consistency: All error displays look and behave the same
  5. Readability: Components are much cleaner and focused

  Example Transformation:

  Before (mixed responsibilities):
  <script>
    // Navigation logic
    const goSomewhere = () => goto(`/weather/${coords}/somewhere`);

    // Data transformation
    const temp = Math.round(celsiusToFahrenheit(data.temp?.value || 0));

    // Repeated error UI
    // Lots of inline validation
  </script>

  After (separated concerns):
  <script>
    import { WeatherNavigation } from '$lib/services/navigation';
    import { getSafeTemperature } from '$lib/services/weatherTransforms';
    import ErrorDisplay from '$lib/components/ErrorDisplay.svelte';

    const goSomewhere = () => WeatherNavigation.goToSomewhere(coords);
    const temperature = getSafeTemperature(data, celsiusToFahrenheit);
  </script>

  <!-- Clean, focused template with reusable components -->

  The architecture is now much more maintainable with clear boundaries between navigation, data processing, and
  presentation logic!
